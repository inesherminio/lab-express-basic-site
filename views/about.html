        <strong>Gabriel García Márquez</strong>, (born March 6, 1927, Aracataca,
        Colombia—died April 17, 2014, Mexico City, Mexico), Colombian novelist
        and one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, who was awarded the
        Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982, mostly for his masterpiece Cien años
        de soledad (1967; One Hundred Years of Solitude). He was the fourth
        Latin American to be so honoured, having been preceded by Chilean poets
        Gabriela Mistral in 1945 and Pablo Neruda in 1971 and by Guatemalan
        novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias in 1967. With Jorge Luis Borges, García
        Márquez is the best-known Latin American writer in history. In addition
        to his masterly approach to the novel, he was a superb crafter of short
        stories and an accomplished journalist. In both his shorter and longer
        fictions, García Márquez achieved the rare feat of being accessible to
        the common reader while satisfying the most demanding of sophisticated
        critics.
